Weighted OFDM


A brief comparison of Partial Transit Scheme , Clipping and Weighted OFDM is done, The obtained results describes Weighted OFDM provides much better reduction of PAPR with less loss of the signal as when compared to Clipping which causes signal loss and WOFDM is easier in implementation and more efficient than Partial Transit Scheme
