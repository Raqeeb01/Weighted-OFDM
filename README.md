Weighted OFDM


During the transmission of the signal in OFDM system, increased PAPR degrades the efficiency of the system leading to decrease in Signal-to-Quantization-Noise ratio (SQNR).  A Proposed algorithm, Weighted OFDM is used to reduce the PAPR and its efficiency is checked through Matlab  simulations
